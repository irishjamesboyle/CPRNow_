## CPRNow

This CPRNow app aims to reduce the number of people needlessly dying of Cardiac Arrest. 

For those around a person who has gone into Cardiac Arrest, they open the app and request a nearby First Responder to come to the scene. The same app can be used by a First Responder to receive requests for help. 

The app was coded using the Java language for the Android mobile Operating System and makes use of various APIs, including Google Maps API, and Firebase to manage registrations, logins and notifications.
